# Credit Card Fraudulent Classification: Project Overview
* The dataset used is open source transaction data from capital one.
* The dataset contains 29 columns/attributes and 641.914 rows/transactions.
* This project is a supervised machine learning problem, the data set offers information on whether the transaction is fraudulent or not for each data point.
* The data was imbalanced and more biased towards non fraudulent/legitimate data points, the solution to this problem is to use a Under or Over Sampling technique to balance the dataset.
* Using 4 different classification algorithms which is Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, XGboost Classifier, and Random Forest and compare these algorithms to find the best classification model for this dataset.
